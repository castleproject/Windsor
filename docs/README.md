# Castle Windsor Documentation

<img align="right" src="images/windsor-logo.png">

Castle Windsor is best of breed, mature [Inversion of Control container](ioc.md) available for .NET.

* See [the release notes](https://github.com/castleproject/Windsor/releases/tag/v3.3)
* [Download it](https://github.com/castleproject/Windsor/releases/tag/v3.3)
* Get official builds from [NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/Castle.Windsor): `PM> Install-Package Castle.Windsor`
* Or [get pre-release packages as they're built](https://github.com/castleproject/Home/blob/master/prerelease-packages.md)

## Show me the code already

Windsor is very simple to use. Code below is not just *hello world* - that's how many big real life applications use Windsor. See the full documentation for more details on the API, features, patterns, and practices.

```csharp
// application starts...
var container = new WindsorContainer();

// adds and configures all components using WindsorInstallers from executing assembly
container.Install(FromAssembly.This());

// instantiate and configure root component and all its dependencies and their dependencies and...
var king = container.Resolve<IKing>();
king.RuleTheCastle();

// clean up, application exits
container.Dispose();
```

So what about those [installers](installers.md)? Here's one.

```csharp
public class RepositoriesInstaller : IWindsorInstaller
{
	public void Install(IWindsorContainer container, IConfigurationStore store)
	{
		container.Register(Classes.FromThisAssembly()
			                .Where(Component.IsInSameNamespaceAs<King>())
			                .WithService.DefaultInterfaces()
			                .LifestyleTransient());
	}
}
```

## Samples and tutorials

Learn Windsor by example by completing step-by-step tutorials. See Windsor in action by exploring sample applications showcasing its capabilities:

* [Basic tutorial](basic-tutorial.md)
* [Simple ASP.NET MVC 3 application (To be Seen)](mvc-tutorial-intro.md) - built step by step from the ground up. This tutorial will help you get up to speed with Windsor quickly while keeping an eye on both the usage of the container API as well as patterns that will help you get the most out of using the container.
