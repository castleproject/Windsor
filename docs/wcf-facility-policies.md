# WCF Facility - Policies

[WCF Integration Facility](wcf-facility.md) policies encapsulate rules regarding behavior of the facility in certain aspects of its functionality. Currently WCF Facility exposes the following kinds of policies:

## Refresh Channel Policy

[Refresh Channel Policy](wcf-facility-refresh-channel-policy.md) controls transparent recycling of client side channel (proxy) when it becomes unusable.

## Channel Action Policy

[Channel Action Policy](wcf-facility-channel-action-policy.md) is kind of like a dedicated [interceptor](interceptors.md) for WCF client side calls.
