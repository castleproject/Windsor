**internal changes and refactorings to do**

- change now interaction with Burden in the creation pipeline happen. Especially try to eliminate the ugly context.AttachExistingBurden(burden); call

- better unify exceptions thrown and start taking advantage of what the exception facilities in Visual Studio and .NET provide.

- scoping per tag:

- container.BeginScope(IDictionary inlineArguments)
	those arguments would be available in each and every resolve (and their subdependencies...?)


- nesting scopes - NOT SUPPORTED

- change the exception thrown when creating typed factory to point out that the facility should be added to the container first, before adding the factory.
